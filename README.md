##Projects:

###Project1- Analyzing the NYC Subway Dataset: Predict Ridership in Rainy and Non-rainy Days
In this analysis, I used ridership data generated in May 2011 New York city (NYC) MTA Subway and weather data generated at the same time and the same region to test the hypothesis that whether rainy days impacts ridership of NYC subway.

###Project2- Data Wrangle OpenStreetMaps: Improve OpenStreetMaps in Las Vegas
OpenStreetMap, an open project to create a free map around the world, is a powerful tool for viewing maps and humanitarian aid. The initial data of the map were collected using a handheld GPS and a notebook, digital camera, or a voice recorder. These data heavily rely on the human input, which may cause inconsistent input, misspellings or error (e.g. inconsistent input of Street, street, st., St.). This project is going to focus on map of Las Vegas, Nevada, USA and wrangling the data: 1) overview data (code: mapparser.py); 2) check the “k” value for each “” (code: tags.py); 3) find out number of unique users contributed to the map (code: users.py); 4) fix unexpected street types (e.g. street, st., St. to be Street) (code: audit.py); 5) transform the shape of data and insert data into mongodb (code: data.py and mongodb.py); 6) use MongoDB queries to find number and names of hotels, and shopping malls (code: query.by).

###Project3- Explore and Summarize Data: Insight into Startups
The startups, generally newly created, are in a phase of development and research for markets.It’s important for both investors and entrepreneurs to understand characteristics of startups such as what are hot markets, where are hot regions and when are hot seasons for investments. To explore that, data of startups from 1990 to 2014 in US were used and analyzed in this project (collected by CruchBase (https://info.crunchbase.com/about/crunchbase-data-exports/)).

###Project4- Machine Learning: Identifying Fraud from Enron Email
Enron Corporation, which was one of the largest companies in the United States in 2000, was an American energy, commodities, and Services Company. In 2002, Enron had filed for bankruptcy because of accounting fraud. In the following federal investigation, a large database of over 600,000 emails generated by 158 employees of Enron was acquired. Subsequently, a copy of the database was purchased and released to public by Andrew McCallum. The dataset was used widely for machine learning studies. In this project, I built a machine learning model using “scikit-learn” built-in algorithm to predict a “person of interest” (“poi”), who may be involved in fraud in Enron.

###Project5- Make Effective Data Visualization: Global Trends for Startup Markets: 1990 to 2014
This data visualization shows global trends of 6 startup market (Software, Biotechnology, Mobile, E-Commerce, Social Media and Real Estate) share from 1990 to 2014. The data was collected from [CruchBase](https://info.crunchbase.com/about/crunchbase-data-exports/).
