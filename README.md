This repository includes projects for data analyst.

Project1 Analyzing the NYC Subway Dataset
In this analysis, I am taking data from May 2011 NYC MTA Subway as provided in the Udacity 'Introduction to Data Science' class and testing the hypothesis that whether rainy days impacts riderships.

Project2 Data Wrangle OpenStreetMaps Data
OpenStreetMap, an open project to create a free map around the world, is a powerful tool for viewing maps and humanitarian aid. The initial data of the map were collected using a handheld GPS and a notebook, digital camera, or a voice recorder. These data heavily rely on the human input, which may cause inconsistent input, misspellings or error (e.g. inconsistent input of Street, street, st., St.). This project is going to focus on map of Las Vegas, Nevada, USA and wrangling the data: 1) overview data (code: mapparser.py); 2) check the “k” value for each “<tag>” (code: tags.py); 3) find out number of unique users contributed to the map (code: users.py); 4) fix unexpected street types (e.g. street, st., St. to be Street) (code: audit.py); 5) transform the shape of data and insert data into mongodb (code: data.py and mongodb.py); 6) use MongoDB queries to find number and names of hotels, and shopping malls (code: query.by). The codes mentioned above are included in a separated file and tested by sample dataset (a part of the whole dataset) before run for the whole dataset. 

Project3 Explore_and_Summarize_Data with R: Insight into Startups
The startups, generally newly created, are in a phase of development and research for markets.It’s important for both investors and entrepreneurs to understand characteristics of startups such as what are hot markets, where are hot regions and when are hot seasons for startups. To explore that, data of startups from 1990 to 2014 in US were used and analyzed in this project (collected by CruchBase (https://info.crunchbase.com/about/crunchbase-data-exports/)).
